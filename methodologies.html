            Variational Autoencoders(VAEs) - Existing Methodology - 1
          </h2>
          <p class="section-content">
            VAEs are deep learning models used for generating diverse and
            realistic medical images. They work by encoding input data into a
            latent space and reconstructing it using a decoder while ensuring
            the latent space follows a predefined probability distribution,
            typically Gaussian. This allows VAEs to learn meaningful patterns
            from medical imaging datasets like MRI scans or X-rays. VAEs are
            particularly beneficial for tasks requiring structured and coherent
            image generation, making them ideal for maintaining anatomical
            accuracy in medical images. However, they may produce blurrier
            outputs compared to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which
            offer higher fidelity but less interpretability. Despite this, VAEs
            remain valuable for medical applications where smoothness,
            consistency, and meaningful latent representations are crucial.

          <h2 class="section-title">Drawbacks</h2>
          <ul class="section-content">
            <li>
              <b>Blurry Outputs: </b>
              VAEs often generate images with lower visual fidelity compared to
              other generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks
              (GANs). This blurriness can be a drawback, especially in
              applications where fine details are important, such as medical
              imaging.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Latent Space Disentanglement: </b>
              While VAEs aim to learn a structured latent space, they may
              struggle to disentangle different factors of variation in the
              data. This means that changing one attribute in the latent space
              might affect multiple aspects of the generated image
              simultaneously, leading to less control over the generation
              process.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Mode Collapse: </b>
              Similar to GANs, VAEs can also suffer from mode collapse, where
              the model generates limited variations of images or fails to
              capture the full diversity of the data distribution. This can
              result in repetitive or unrealistic outputs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Limited Expressiveness: </b>
              VAEs rely on a predefined prior distribution for the latent space,
              often a Gaussian distribution. While this simplifies the training
              process, it can limit the expressiveness of the model, making it
              less capable of capturing complex data distributions effectively.

            Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) - Existing Methodology - 2
          </h2>
          <p class="section-content">
            CNNs are widely used in medical image generation, particularly in
            tasks such as image synthesis, enhancement, and reconstruction. CNNs
            learn spatial hierarchies from images, making them effective for
            capturing structural details in medical imaging applications like
            MRI, CT scans, and X-rays.

          <h2 class="section-title">Drawbacks</h2>
          <ul class="section-content">
            <li>
              <b>Limited Global Context Understanding: </b>
              CNNs primarily focus on local features, missing broader spatial
              relationships, which is critical in medical imaging.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Lack of Diversity in Generated Images: </b>
              CNNs may struggle to generate diverse images, leading to mode
              collapse in synthetic image generation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>High Data Requirements: </b>
              Training CNN-based generative models requires a large dataset,
              which is often scarce in medical imaging.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Vulnerability to Overfitting: </b>
              CNNs may overfit small datasets, reducing generalization to new
              medical cases.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Difficulty in Capturing Fine-Scale Details: </b>
              CNNs can lose fine structural details, leading to suboptimal image
              reconstruction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Computationally Expensive: </b>
              Training deep CNN architectures requires high computational
              resources, making real-time image generation challenging.

          <h2 class="section-title">Proposed Methodology</h2>
          <p class="section-content">
            Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of artificial
            intelligence models introduced by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues
            in 2014. They consist of two neural networks: the generator and the
            discriminator, which are trained simultaneously through an
            adversarial process.
          </p>
          <ul class="section-content">
            <li>
              <b>Generator : </b>The generator's role is to generate synthetic
              data that resembles the real data it was trained on. It takes
              random noise or a latent input as its initial input and transforms
              it into a sample that ideally cannot be distinguished from real
              data by the discriminator. Initially, the generator produces
              random noise, but as training progresses, it learns to generate
              increasingly realistic samples through backpropagation and
              gradient descent, optimizing its parameters to minimize the
              difference between generated and real data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Discriminator : </b>The discriminator acts as a binary
              classifier, distinguishing between real and fake data. It is
              trained on a dataset containing real samples and samples generated
              by the generator. The discriminator's objective is to correctly
              classify real data as real and generated data as fake. Like the
              generator, the discriminator's parameters are optimized through
              backpropagation and gradient descent to improve its ability to
              differentiate between real and fake samples.

        <div class="content-section">
          <p class="section-content">
            The training process of GANs involves a continual interplay between
            the generator and the discriminator:
          </p>
          <h4>Training Phase:</h4>
          <ul class="section-content">
            <li>
              Initially, the generator produces fake data from random noise, and
              the discriminator is trained on both real and fake data, learning
              to distinguish between them.
            </li>
            <li>
              The discriminator provides feedback to the generator by indicating
              how well it is generating realistic samples.
            </li>
            <li>
              The generator adjusts its parameters to produce samples that are
              more likely to fool the discriminator, thus improving its ability
              to generate realistic data.
            </li>
            <li>
              This adversarial process continues iteratively, with both networks
              updating their parameters in opposing directions, until a point of
              equilibrium is reached where the generator produces data that is
              indistinguishable from real data.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Convergence:</h4>
          <ul class="section-content">
            <li>
              Ideally, when GANs converge, the generator generates data that is
              indistinguishable from real data, and the discriminator is no
              longer able to differentiate between real and fake samples with
              high confidence.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, achieving convergence can be challenging and is
              influenced by factors such as network architecture, training data
              quality, and hyperparameters.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once trained, the generator can be used independently to produce
              realistic synthetic data, which can have various applications such
              as image synthesis, data augmentation, and anomaly detection.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="section-content">
            Overall, GANs leverage the adversarial relationship between the
            generator and discriminator to learn the underlying distribution of
            the training data and generate new samples that closely resemble
            real data. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) represent a
            cutting-edge approach to data augmentation and synthesis in machine
            learning tasks, including medical image analysis for kidney
            diagnostics. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a
            discriminator, which are trained simultaneously through an
            adversarial process. The generator synthesizes new data samples,
            while the discriminator distinguishes between real and fake samples.
            This iterative training process encourages the generator to produce
            increasingly realistic data, ultimately generating novel instances
            that closely resemble real examples.
